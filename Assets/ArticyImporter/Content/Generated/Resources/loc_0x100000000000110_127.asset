  - Hello.
  - Popipopipo
  - On est sur le State 02
  - 'Yukiko wakes up in her home, feeling weary and sluggish, having spent the night
    tossing and turning. As she goes through her monring routine she starts gathering
    materials: some wax, a string and a pot of black ink, getting to her working
    bench.'
  - (I lack some items. I needed some wax, a string, and a pot of black ink.)
  - <i>Once she finished the candle, Yukiko steps away from her work bench. With
    the candle in hand and walks over to the butsudan dedicated to her late brother.</i>
  - I can't believe this happened... What changed? Was it because of your master's
    death? Was it too much? But why not tell me in that case? We always shared everything...
  - "<i>Yukiko hears a knock at her front door, she stands walking over to her front
    door and opening it, seeing her fianc\xE9 standing there with a small sympathetic
    smile on his kind face.</i>"
  - Hello my love, how are you faring? <i>he</i><i> says in a soft voice</i>
  - Hello my dear, I've been better, quite honestly, I really didn't expect this,
    I don't understand how this could happen.
  - I can't believe he would do this, it has to be the the work of yokais! I know
    my brother, I know he wouldn't do this.
  - I don't understand how this could happen, Souma. He never said anything, I know
    we couldn't see each other as much with his new responsibilities but...
  - Calm, my love. I know this news has troubled you but do not make hasty conclusions.
  - <i>Souma hugs Yukiko.</i>
  - I truly am sorry, my love. Kotaro was my friend, I deeply regret his passing
    as well and I wish I could take your pain away.
  - I'm sure the people at the castle might have answers, perhaps you should go visit
    there and ask for lord Aoyama, he was in charge of the monks after all.
  - You're right, of course, I will go there immediatly.
  - <i>Yukiko enters the castle, seeing the lord of the citadelle standing in the
    main hall</i><i>. He interpels loudly Yukiko.</i>
  - Miss Fukuda! I don't need a second one of you causing problems in my citadel!
  - My lord. I'm here because I would like to ask some questions about my brother.
  - What questions?! I have enough to do with the problems your brother's death has
    caused!
  - Problems? What problems, my lord?
  - <i>Yukiko frowns.</i>
  - <i>In response, Yukiko speaks with a low voice.</i>
  - Kotaro burned the one and only recipe of the Safety powder! Our stocks are running
    dry, miss Fukuda, we only have enough to last us three days, two if we abandon
    a part of the citadel, which will not happen.
  - As my brother was responsible for that perhaps I could be of help, my lord? If
    you let me I could look to restore the recipe.
  - Yes, go and make yourself useful! Go talk to Fukuro in the library, I'm sure
    he'd be able to guide you on the right path.
  - Oh and go take a look at your brother's office, I'm sure you could find something
    useful there.
  - As you say, my lord.
  - <i>Yukiko bows as she leaves the conversation.</i>
  - '<i>An </i><i>old</i><i> creature that</i><i> ressembles an owl,</i><i> was</i><i>
    standing </i><i>on his perch. There is no doubt: it''s a Yokai. But this one
    seems friendly and helps the castle.</i>'
  - (This has to be Fukuro.)
  - Hello, Fukuro? I am Fukuda Yukiko, lord Aoyama has told me to seek you out for
    help in finding a solution for the Safety Powder.
  - Ah yes miss Fukuda, young Kotaro's sister. You are here to inquire my help? I
    hope you know it will not be that easy.
  - It won't? Do I need to do something for you, Fukuro?
  - Yes you do indeed.
  - I find myself quite bored in recent days, young Yukiko, perhaps you could find
    me something new to pass the time?
  - What do you have in mind?
  - Young Yukiko, sometimes, the answer of your questions lies right in front of
    your eyes.
  - (It has to be something related to the library... <b>A scroll with a story </b>written
    in it, perhaps?)
  - (I think <b>I found one already</b>, but I'm not sure <b>where</b> it was.)
  - (Perhaps <b>Souma</b> have something in stock. He is a merchant after all, he
    might be in the <b>Main Street</b>.)
  - (I shouldn't bother Fukuro.)
  - (If I reckon correctly, Fukuro wanted a <b>scroll </b>with a <b>story </b>written
    in it.)
  - <i>Souma is at his merchant's stand. Despite the news, he's still smiling and
    enjoys its work.</i>
  - Souma, dear!
  - <i>Souma lay his eyes on Yukiko and welcomes her with a happy smile.</i>
  - My love, were you able to find your answers?
  - No, sadly not. But I've decided to take up the task of finding a solution to
    the shortage of Safety powder
  - I see, I'm sure you'll be able to help as ressourceful as you usually are.
  - <i>Souma speak softly, his voice betrays how uneasy he is currently feeling about
    the current situation</i>
  - Yes, I'm hoping to have Fukuro to help me but he wants something in return before
    he gives me any informations. I'm pretty sure he wants a new story he hasn't
    read before. Could you sell me some scrolls?
  - Sell? No, I can't sell you some scrolls, but I can give them to you for free,
    my love.
  - He smiles to Yukiko while handing her a single scroll.
  - Are you sure, dear? I can easily pay for them.
  - There is truly no need, my love. Do not worry about it. Although perhaps you
    could come visit me again later? I wish to discuss something with you when you
    have some time.
  - Is there something you need, my love?
  - Not really, I still have to <b>create the story in the scroll </b>and bring it
    to <b>Fukuro</b>.
  - With the <b>scroll</b> I gave you, you might be able to achieve it. Don't you
    have anything at your home to <b>write </b>on the scroll and <b>tie</b> it?
  - Souma. You are wonderful, thank you!
  - I'm back with a new story for you Fukuro.
  - <i>Yukiko hands Fukuro the scroll and he starts ready through it</i>
  - Ah, thank you, young Yukiko. Yes that's good.
  - Do you accept to help me and answer my questions now?
  - Indeed, what did you wish to know?
  - I've told lord Aoyama that I will help find a solution to recreate the Safety
    powder and he told me you could help, do you perhaps know any of the ingredients?
  - Now, young Yukiko, giving you the ingredients would be too easy, but I will help
    you by giving you hints, you will have to use your mind to figure out the ingredients
    to this <b>powder</b>.
  - (Is he serious? We need this powder for the citadel safety and he wants to give
    me riddles?!)
  - Thank you Fukuro.
  - Young Yukiko, I hope you have a <b>clear idea</b> of the two mains ingredients
    of the Safety Powder.
  - <i>Fukuro look Yukiko as if he already knew that she doesn't have any. He is
    judging her.</i>
  - Oh... Of course! It is just... that... I think I... forgot something... I'll
    bring it back to you...
  - Once you have the hints, don't remember to <b>associate it.</b>
  - Hello my dear, how has your day been so far?
  - Souma, dear, you wished to speak to me?
  - My love, hi. My day has been fine, you have good timing, I wished to speak to
    you
  - Of course, what about?
  - I wanted to let you know that our usual walk in the park once we finish work
    for the day won't be possible for the forseeable futur as the park seems to be
    blocked.
  - Oh... I see, do you know why?
  - Sadly not, my love. I think you will need to go talk to lord <b>Aoyama</b> again.
  - Very well, thank you dear.
  - Ah yes, hello again my love. I just wanted to let you know that our usual walk
    in the park once we finish work for the day won't be possible for the forseeable
    future <b>as the park seems to be blocked</b>.
  - (Souma is working, I shouldn't bother him. On top of that, he told me to ask
    <b>lord Aoyama </b>about <b>the park</b>.)
  - (Although, I like to watch him work... He's kinda cute.)
  - An aged samurai is wandering around, seeming lost and frantic.
  - Excuse me sir? I couldn't help but wonder if you perhaps needed help?
  - Ah! Yes, I do indeed, I've lost a <b>potrait of my late family</b> and I cannot
    for the life of me remember where I could have lost it.
  - Oh, I think I've picked up what you're looking for. *She hands him the portrait*
  - I'll help you sir. Could you tell me where you've been today so I could narrow
    the search?
  - Thank you, miss. I've been <b>in the castle </b>a good part of the day. The potrait
    sits in a wood frame.
  - I'll look for it and bring it to you then.
  - Have you found my portrait?
  - Not yet.
  - I'll keep looking in the main street. Can you look inside the <b>castle</b> ?
  - Sir, I've found your lost portrait.
  - <i>Yukiko hands the portrait to the samurai.</i>
  - Oh thank you, miss. What could I give you in thanks?
  - Well, I couldn't help but notice your armour, are you perhaps a samurai?
  - I am indeed, my name is Takenaka Moriyama. Can I help you with something miss...?
  - Oh yes, pardon my manners, my name is Fukuda Yukiko.
  - <i>Yukiko bows politely.</i>
  - Could you answer a question for me as thanks for finding your missing portait?
  - Of course, please go ahead.
  - Well as I'm sure you know, we use a powder to ward ourselves against Yokais and
    we've lost the recipe so I've decided to search for them and since <b>the powder
    needs to burn</b> I was wondering if you had <b>seen it in action</b> and if
    you could help me?
  - Well, I have seen it in action and what marked me the most is <b>how fast it
    burns</b>. It was <b>near instant</b>. Does that help you miss Fukuda?
  - Yes, it does, thank you sir.
  - Please call me Moriyama.
  - Then call me Yukiko. Goodbye Moriyama.
  - <i>Moriyama bows, and starts walking away, without leaving his eyes from the
    picture.</i>
  - (I'm feeling more confident to talk to lord Aoyama, since I have the <b>seal
    of truth</b>.)
  - <i>As Yukiko closes the gap between her and the lord, she grabs the seal and
    put it right in front of Aoyama.</i>
  - (Weird... Nothing seems different. I'll still try and talk to him.)
  - What frustrates you, my lord?
  - Your brother seems to have ordered a large amount of <b>a very expensive ingredient</b>
    but I cannot find out what it is.
  - I see, thank you my lord.
  - <i>Lord Aoyama is walking in an endless circle, his face seeming tense.</i>
  - My lord? What seems to frustrate you so?
  - Not right now, miss Fukuda. You are supposed to find a solution to the powder
    shortage. Get to it instead of burrowing your nose where it should not.
  - (Well. This was welcoming.)
  - (If it is <b>related to my brother</b>, I have to know.)
  - (But who should I <b>ask</b> for clues?)
  - (Hm... I prefer avoiding Aoyama for now.)
  - (But maybe <b>someone</b> can help me to know what's in his mind.)
  - Fukuro, lord Aoyama seems frustrated and I was wondering if you knew what that
    was about? He didn't seem to want to talk about it.
  - While I cannot answer that question, I'm sure something here in the library could
    help you make him talk.
  - (Argh... He cannot be straight to the point, can he?)
  - I'll take a look around then.
  - Fukuro, I find the recipe of the "<b>Seal of Truth</b>", shall I use it?
  - Ehm... Hey... Fukuro... I've been searching for something to help me know what's
    inside <b>Aoyama's mind</b>. You told me I can find something to help me... but
    where was it, again?
  - It is only up to you, young Yukiko. But first, you will have to gather some <b>black
    ink</b>, a <b>scroll</b>, and some <b>spirit powder</b>.
  - And then, you will have to hear a deep truth to fill the <b>seal</b> with magic.
    But don't expect me to help you on that.
  - What is the <b>spirit powder</b>?
  - It is some powder that Yokai leaves behind them. It is a rare ressource, you
    wont find any at the <b>locals merchants</b>.
  - <i>Fukuro stares deeply into Yukiko's eyes. She starts feeling uncomfortable.</i>
  - Uhm... Yes, probably <b>here</b>! I'll keep searching!
  - Souma, my dear, I need you to help me on something.
  - Yes, my love?
  - Could you tell me an absolute truth? Something you know you would never lie about?
  - Of course, my love.
  - <i>Souma leans in slightly and whispers in Yukiko's ear.</i>
  - I love you, Yukiko.
  - Oh... (How can I resist this?) I love you too, Souma.
  - <i>After smiling unconsciously Yukiko notice the </i><b><i>seal</i></b><i> seems
    </i><b><i>full of magic</i></b><i>.</i>
  - (This has to be it! Now, I may be able to know what's on <b>lord Aoyama's mind</b>!)
  - Souma, dear, could you spare a scroll for me? I can pay for it of course
  - Dear, I need another scroll, can you spare one?
  - Of course, my love, anything for you.
  - Of course, my love, there is no need to pay, here you go.
  - Thank you dear.
  - Do you need anything from me, Yukiko?
  - I'm looking for some <b>black ink</b> and some <b>spiritual powder</b>.
  - I have... never heard of <b>spiritual powder</b>.
  - <i>Souma seems like something is off.</i>
  - But, don't you have some <b>black ink</b> at home?
  - I'll have to check. Thanks for your help, dear!
  - Do you need my assistance? Perhaps, you need to hear my deep truth once more,
    my love?
  - I can't lie... this is tempting. But I have to focus, dear!
  - <i>Souma smiles as he is selling something to a customer.</i>
  - We will have plenty of time to talk tonight. For now, let's both do what me must.
    Go Yukiko, go!
  - See you later, dear!
  - Love you too, my love.
  - (I definitely have to focus. Now. Otherwise, I will spend my whole day at his
    side.)
  - Fukuro, I've found the first two ingredients of the Safety Powder! It's jade
    powder and momij's leak.
  - <i>The owl Yokai nods two times.</i>
  - Well done, young Yukiko.
  - Do you know anything about the last ingredient?
  - It won't be as simple as just me telling you.
  - Here are three scrolls that should help you find the last ingredient to the Safety
    Powder.
  - <i>With one wing, Fukuro points three scrolls on a table below.</i>
  - Is the answer written inside these?
  - Not exactly, young Yukiko. You will have to understand with the titles only.
  - I will give you a riddle, and you will have to find the corresponding word in
    one of the three scrolls' title.
  - (At this point, I would prefer reading the three whole scrolls instead of playing
    his games...)
  - Let's not waste any time.
  - My first is something <b>that only lives</b> inside <b>living beings</b>.
  - <i>Yukiko gets closer to the scrolls, reading each one's name.</i>
  - "<i>The first is \xAB Purity Lies at the Bottom \xBB.</i>"
  - "<i>The second, \xAB To Appease a God: The Art of a Worthy Sacrifice \xBB.</i>"
  - "<i>The last one: \xAB His Love Was Buried, Not His Soul \xBB.</i>"
  - <i>In which scroll will Yukiko find the word Fukuro is asking for?</i>
  - Now, young Yukiko, think again.
  - A <b>soul</b>! Great, young Yukiko. There is still two words that you will have
    to guess...
  - My second is something you need to take <b>from yourself</b> in exhange <b>for
    someone</b> or <b>something else</b>.
  - You're wrong, young Yukiko. Think again.
  - It is a <b>sacrifice</b>. You may be more cunning than what I've first expected.
  - My third is something yokai are scared of, something <b>clean</b>, like <b>water
    collected from the spring</b>.
  - (Did he just assume I was stupid, based on my looks?)
  - You are almost there, but it is not the right answer. Listen closely young Yukiko.
  - Good job, young Yukiko, you've gotten them all right. Now, my whole is the <b>final
    ingredient of the powder's recipe</b>.
  - I thought you were smarter than this young Yukiko, you shame your brother.
  - I thought you were smarter than this young Yukiko, you shame your brother.
  - I knew you could figure it out, young Yukiko. Your brother would be proud.
  - But... A child's soul? That's horrible. I... I just can't...
  - Perhaps you should take some time to process this information, young Yukiko.
  - <i>In a mix of bad feelings, Yukiko trails off, starting to run away from the
    castle.</i>
  - (I need to talk to Souma, perhaps he could help me. Or at least, lend me an ear.)
  - (I need to keep this a secret, if it were known it could cause chaos.)
  - <i>After asking to Souma to talk to her at her own house, Yukiko stands in the
    middle of the room, filled with doubts.</i>
  - <i>Not so long after that, Souma joins Yukiko.</i>
  - Sorry for the wait, my love.
  - Souma, do you have some time to talk about something really serious?
  - Of course, my love, always for you
  - I've found all the ingredients for the Safety Powder but the last one... It's
    a <b>child's soul</b>! I don't know what to do...
  - A child's-? I'm sure we can find another solution, surely it doesn't ask for
    such a heavy sacrifice. It's ok, my love, I'll help you find another solution.
  - Really? I- Thank you, my dear, I truly do not know what to do.
  - You should rest, we'll think on it tomorrow.
  - Right, yes, of course, I'll see you tomorrow then.
  - <i>Souma approaches the trembling Yukiko and gives her a warm and comforting
    hug.</i>
  - Take care of you, my love. Empty your mind of these thougts, we're going to be
    ok.
  - Thank you, dear. Thank you.
  - Yukiko
  - Souma
  - Moriyama
  - Aoyama
