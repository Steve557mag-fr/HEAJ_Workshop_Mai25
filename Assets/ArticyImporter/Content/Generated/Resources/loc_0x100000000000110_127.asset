  - Hello.
  - Popipopipo
  - On est sur le State 02
  - 'Yukiko wakes up in her home, feeling weary and sluggish, having spent the night
    tossing and turning. As she goes through her monring routine she starts gathering
    materials: some wax, a string and a pot of black ink, getting to her working
    bench.'
  - (I lack some items. I needed some <b>wax</b>, a <b>string</b>, and a pot of <b>black
    ink</b>.)
  - <i>Once she finished the candle, Yukiko steps away from her work bench. With
    the candle in hand and walks over to the butsudan dedicated to her late brother.</i>
  - I can't believe this happened... What changed? Was it because of your master's
    death? Was it too much? But why not tell me in that case? We always shared everything...
  - "<i>Yukiko hears a knock at her front door, she stands walking over to her front
    door and opening it, seeing her fianc\xE9 standing there with a small sympathetic
    smile on his kind face.</i>"
  - Hello my love, how are you faring? <i>he</i><i> says in a soft voice</i>
  - Hello my dear, I've been better, quite honestly, I really didn't expect this,
    I don't understand how this could happen.
  - I can't believe he would do this, it has to be the the work of yokais! I know
    my brother, I know he wouldn't do this.
  - I don't understand how this could happen, Souma. He never said anything, I know
    we couldn't see each other as much with his new responsibilities but...
  - Calm, my love. I know this news has troubled you but do not make hasty conclusions.
  - <i>Souma hugs Yukiko.</i>
  - I truly am sorry, my love. Kotaro was my friend, I deeply regret his passing
    as well and I wish I could take your pain away.
  - I'm sure the people at the castle might have answers, perhaps you should go visit
    there and ask for lord Aoyama, he was in charge of the monks after all.
  - You're right, of course, I will go there immediatly.
  - <i>Yukiko enters the castle, seeing the lord of the citadelle standing in the
    main hall</i><i>. He interpels loudly Yukiko.</i>
  - Miss Fukuda! I don't need a second one of you causing problems in my citadel!
  - My lord. I'm here because I would like to ask some questions about my brother.
  - What questions?! I have enough to do with the problems your brother's death has
    caused!
  - Problems? What problems, my lord?
  - <i>Yukiko frowns.</i>
  - <i>In response, Yukiko speaks with a low voice.</i>
  - Kotaro burned the one and only recipe of the Safety powder! Our stocks are running
    dry, miss Fukuda, we only have enough to last us three days, two if we abandon
    a part of the citadel, which will not happen.
  - As my brother was responsible for that perhaps I could be of help, my lord? If
    you let me I could look to restore the recipe.
  - Yes, go and make yourself useful! Go talk to Fukuro in the library, I'm sure
    he'd be able to guide you on the right path.
  - Oh and go take a look at your brother's office, I'm sure you could find something
    useful there.
  - As you say, my lord.
  - <i>Yukiko bows as she leaves the conversation.</i>
  - '<i>An </i><i>old</i><i> creature that</i><i> ressembles an owl,</i><i> was</i><i>
    standing </i><i>on his perch. There is no doubt: it''s a Yokai. But this one
    seems friendly and helps the castle.</i>'
  - (This has to be Fukuro.)
  - Hello, Fukuro? I am Fukuda Yukiko, lord Aoyama has told me to seek you out for
    help in finding a solution for the Safety Powder.
  - Ah yes miss Fukuda, young Kotaro's sister. You are here to inquire my help? I
    hope you know it will not be that easy.
  - It won't? Do I need to do something for you, Fukuro?
  - Yes you do indeed.
  - I find myself quite bored in recent days, young Yukiko, perhaps you could find
    me something new to pass the time?
  - What do you have in mind?
  - Young Yukiko, sometimes, the answer of your questions lies right in front of
    your eyes.
  - (It has to be something related to the library... <b>A scroll with a story </b>written
    in it, perhaps?)
  - (I think <b>I found one already</b>, but I'm not sure <b>where</b> it was.)
  - (Perhaps <b>Souma</b> have something in stock. He is a merchant after all, he
    might be in the <b>Main Street</b>.)
  - (I shouldn't bother Fukuro.)
  - (If I reckon correctly, Fukuro wanted a <b>scroll </b>with a <b>story </b>written
    in it.)
  - <i>Souma is at his merchant's stand. Despite the news, he's still smiling and
    enjoys its work.</i>
  - Souma, dear!
  - <i>Souma lay his eyes on Yukiko and welcomes her with a happy smile.</i>
  - My love, were you able to find your answers?
  - No, sadly not. But I've decided to take up the task of finding a solution to
    the shortage of Safety powder
  - I see, I'm sure you'll be able to help as ressourceful as you usually are.
  - <i>Souma speak softly, his voice betrays how uneasy he is currently feeling about
    the current situation</i>
  - Yes, I'm hoping to have Fukuro to help me but he wants something in return before
    he gives me any informations. I'm pretty sure he wants a new story he hasn't
    read before. Could you sell me some scrolls?
  - Sell? No, I can't sell you some scrolls, but I can give them to you for free,
    my love.
  - He smiles to Yukiko while handing her a single scroll.
  - Are you sure, dear? I can easily pay for them.
  - There is truly no need, my love. Do not worry about it. Although perhaps you
    could come visit me again later? I wish to discuss something with you when you
    have some time.
  - Is there something you need, my love?
  - Not really, I still have to <b>create the story in the scroll </b>and bring it
    to <b>Fukuro</b>.
  - With the <b>scroll</b> I gave you, you might be able to achieve it. Don't you
    have anything at your home to <b>write </b>on the scroll and <b>tie</b> it?
  - Souma. You are wonderful, thank you!
  - I'm back with a new story for you Fukuro.
  - <i>Yukiko hands Fukuro the scroll and he starts ready through it</i>
  - Ah, thank you, young Yukiko. Yes that's good.
  - Do you accept to help me and answer my questions now?
  - Indeed, what did you wish to know?
  - I've told lord Aoyama that I will help find a solution to recreate the Safety
    powder and he told me you could help, do you perhaps know any of the ingredients?
  - Now, young Yukiko, giving you the ingredients would be too easy, but I will help
    you by giving you hints, you will have to use your mind to figure out the ingredients
    to this <b>powder</b>.
  - (Is he serious? We need this powder for the citadel safety and he wants to give
    me riddles?!)
  - Thank you Fukuro.
  - Young Yukiko, I hope you have a <b>clear idea</b> of the two mains ingredients
    of the Safety Powder.
  - <i>Fukuro look Yukiko as if he already knew that she doesn't have any. He is
    judging her.</i>
  - Oh... Of course! It is just... that... I think I... forgot something... I'll
    bring it back to you...
  - Once you have the hints, don't remember to <b>associate it.</b>
  - Hello my dear, how has your day been so far?
  - Souma, dear, you wished to speak to me?
  - My love, hi. My day has been fine, you have good timing, I wished to speak to
    you
  - Of course, what about?
  - I wanted to let you know that our usual walk in the park once we finish work
    for the day won't be possible for the forseeable future as the park seems to
    be blocked.
  - Oh... I see, do you know why?
  - Sadly not, my love. I think you will need to go talk to lord <b>Aoyama</b> again.
  - Very well, thank you dear.
  - Ah yes, hello again my love. I just wanted to let you know that our usual walk
    in the park once we finish work for the day won't be possible for the forseeable
    future <b>as the park seems to be blocked</b>.
  - (Souma is working, I shouldn't bother him. On top of that, he told me to ask
    <b>lord Aoyama </b>about <b>the park</b>.)
  - (Although, I like to watch him work... He's kinda cute.)
  - An aged samurai is wandering around, seeming lost and frantic.
  - Excuse me sir? I couldn't help but wonder if you perhaps needed help?
  - Ah! Yes, I do indeed, I've lost a <b>potrait of my late family</b> and I cannot
    for the life of me remember where I could have lost it.
  - Oh, I think I've picked up what you're looking for. *She hands him the portrait*
  - I'll help you sir. Could you tell me where you've been today so I could narrow
    the search?
  - Thank you, miss. I've been <b>in the castle </b>a good part of the day. The potrait
    sits in a wood frame.
  - I'll look for it and bring it to you then.
  - Have you found my portrait?
  - Not yet.
  - I'll keep looking in the main street. Can you look inside the <b>castle</b> ?
  - Sir, I've found your lost portrait.
  - <i>Yukiko hands the portrait to the samurai.</i>
  - Oh thank you, miss. What could I give you in thanks?
  - Well, I couldn't help but notice your armour, are you perhaps a samurai?
  - I am indeed, my name is Takenaka Moriyama. Can I help you with something miss...?
  - Oh yes, pardon my manners, my name is Fukuda Yukiko.
  - <i>Yukiko bows politely.</i>
  - Could you answer a question for me as thanks for finding your missing portait?
  - Of course, please go ahead.
  - Well as I'm sure you know, we use a powder to ward ourselves against Yokais and
    we've lost the recipe so I've decided to search for them and since <b>the powder
    needs to burn</b> I was wondering if you had <b>seen it in action</b> and if
    you could help me?
  - Well, I have seen it in action and what marked me the most is <b>how fast it
    burns</b>. It was <b>near instant</b>. Does that help you miss Fukuda?
  - Yes, it does, thank you sir.
  - Please call me Moriyama.
  - Then call me Yukiko. Goodbye Moriyama.
  - <i>Moriyama bows, and starts walking away, without leaving his eyes from the
    picture.</i>
  - (I'm feeling more confident to talk to lord Aoyama, since I have the <b>seal
    of truth</b>.)
  - <i>As Yukiko closes the gap between her and the lord, she grabs the seal and
    put it right in front of Aoyama.</i>
  - (Weird... Nothing seems different. I'll still try and talk to him.)
  - What frustrates you, my lord?
  - Your brother seems to have ordered a large amount of <b>a very expensive ingredient</b>
    but I cannot find out what it is.
  - I see, thank you my lord.
  - <i>Lord Aoyama is walking in an endless circle, his face seeming tense.</i>
  - My lord? What seems to frustrate you so?
  - Not right now, miss Fukuda. You are supposed to find a solution to the powder
    shortage. Get to it instead of burrowing your nose where it should not.
  - (Well. This was welcoming.)
  - (If it is <b>related to my brother</b>, I have to know.)
  - (But who should I <b>ask</b> for clues?)
  - (Hm... I prefer avoiding Aoyama for now.)
  - (But maybe <b>someone</b> can help me to know what's in his mind.)
  - Fukuro, lord Aoyama seems frustrated and I was wondering if you knew what that
    was about? He didn't seem to want to talk about it.
  - While I cannot answer that question, I'm sure something here in the library could
    help you make him talk.
  - (Argh... He cannot be straight to the point, can he?)
  - I'll take a look around then.
  - Fukuro, I find the recipe of the "<b>Seal of Truth</b>", shall I use it?
  - Ehm... Hey... Fukuro... I've been searching for something to help me know what's
    inside <b>Aoyama's mind</b>. You told me I can find something to help me... but
    where was it, again?
  - It is only up to you, young Yukiko. But first, you will have to gather some <b>black
    ink</b>, a <b>scroll</b>, and some <b>spirit powder</b>.
  - And then, you will have to hear a deep truth to fill the <b>seal</b> with magic.
    But don't expect me to help you on that.
  - What is the <b>spirit powder</b>?
  - It is some powder that Yokai leaves behind them. It is a rare ressource, you
    wont find any at the <b>locals merchants</b>.
  - <i>Fukuro stares deeply into Yukiko's eyes. She starts feeling uncomfortable.</i>
  - Uhm... Yes, probably <b>here</b>! I'll keep searching!
  - Souma, my dear, I need you to help me on something.
  - Yes, my love?
  - Could you tell me an absolute truth? Something you know you would never lie about?
  - Of course, my love.
  - <i>Souma leans in slightly and whispers in Yukiko's ear.</i>
  - I love you, Yukiko.
  - Oh... (How can I resist this?) I love you too, Souma.
  - <i>After smiling unconsciously Yukiko notice the </i><b><i>seal</i></b><i> seems
    </i><b><i>full of magic</i></b><i>.</i>
  - (This has to be it! Now, I may be able to know what's on <b>lord Aoyama's mind</b>!)
  - Souma, dear, could you spare a scroll for me? I can pay for it of course
  - Dear, I need another scroll, can you spare one?
  - Of course, my love, anything for you.
  - Of course, my love, there is no need to pay, here you go.
  - Thank you dear.
  - Do you need anything from me, Yukiko?
  - I'm looking for some <b>black ink</b> and some <b>spiritual powder</b>.
  - I have... never heard of <b>spiritual powder</b>.
  - <i>Souma seems like something is off.</i>
  - But, don't you have some <b>black ink</b> at home?
  - I'll have to check. Thanks for your help, dear!
  - Do you need my assistance? Perhaps, you need to hear my deep truth once more,
    my love?
  - I can't lie... this is tempting. But I have to focus, dear!
  - <i>Souma smiles as he is selling something to a customer.</i>
  - We will have plenty of time to talk tonight. For now, let's both do what me must.
    Go Yukiko, go!
  - See you later, dear!
  - Love you too, my love.
  - (I definitely have to focus. Now. Otherwise, I will spend my whole day at his
    side.)
  - Fukuro, I've found the first two ingredients of the Safety Powder! It's jade
    powder and momij's leak.
  - <i>The owl Yokai nods two times.</i>
  - Well done, young Yukiko.
  - Do you know anything about the last ingredient?
  - It won't be as simple as just me telling you.
  - Here are three scrolls that should help you find the last ingredient to the Safety
    Powder.
  - <i>With one wing, Fukuro points three scrolls on a table below.</i>
  - Is the answer written inside these?
  - Not exactly, young Yukiko. You will have to understand with the titles only.
  - I will give you a riddle, and you will have to find the corresponding word in
    one of the three scrolls' title.
  - (At this point, I would prefer reading the three whole scrolls instead of playing
    his games...)
  - Let's not waste any time.
  - My first is something <b>that only lives</b> inside <b>living beings</b>.
  - <i>Yukiko gets closer to the scrolls, reading each one's name.</i>
  - "<i>The first is \xAB Purity Lies at the Bottom \xBB.</i>"
  - "<i>The second, \xAB To Appease a God: The Art of a Worthy Sacrifice \xBB.</i>"
  - "<i>The last one: \xAB His Love Was Buried, Not His Soul \xBB.</i>"
  - <i>In which scroll will Yukiko find the word Fukuro is asking for?</i>
  - Now, young Yukiko, think again.
  - A <b>soul</b>! Great, young Yukiko. There is still two words that you will have
    to guess...
  - My second is something you need to take <b>from yourself</b> in exhange <b>for
    someone</b> or <b>something else</b>.
  - You're wrong, young Yukiko. Think again.
  - It is a <b>sacrifice</b>. You may be more cunning than what I've first expected.
  - My third is something yokai are scared of, something <b>clean</b>, like <b>water
    collected from the spring</b>.
  - (Did he just assume I was stupid, based on my looks?)
  - You are almost there, but it is not the right answer. Listen closely young Yukiko.
  - Good job, young Yukiko, you've gotten them all right. Now, my whole is the <b>final
    ingredient of the powder's recipe</b>.
  - I thought you were smarter than this young Yukiko, you shame your brother.
  - I thought you were smarter than this young Yukiko, you shame your brother.
  - I knew you could figure it out, young Yukiko. Your brother would be proud.
  - But... A child's soul? That's horrible. I... I just can't...
  - Perhaps you should take some time to process this information, young Yukiko.
  - <i>In a mix of bad feelings, Yukiko trails off, starting to run away from the
    castle.</i>
  - (I need to talk to Souma, perhaps he could help me. Or at least, lend me an ear.)
  - (I need to keep this a secret, if it were known it could cause chaos.)
  - <i>After asking to Souma to talk to her at her own house, Yukiko stands in the
    middle of the room, filled with doubts.</i>
  - <i>Not so long after that, Souma joins Yukiko.</i>
  - Sorry for the wait, my love.
  - Souma, do you have some time to talk about something really serious?
  - Of course, my love, always for you
  - I've found all the ingredients for the Safety Powder but the last one... It's
    a <b>child's soul</b>! I don't know what to do...
  - A child's-? I'm sure we can find another solution, surely it doesn't ask for
    such a heavy sacrifice. It's ok, my love, I'll help you find another solution.
  - Really? I- Thank you, my dear, I truly do not know what to do.
  - You should rest, we'll think on it tomorrow.
  - Right, yes, of course, I'll see you tomorrow then.
  - <i>Souma approaches the trembling Yukiko and gives her a warm and comforting
    hug.</i>
  - Take care of you, my love. Empty your mind of these thougts, we're going to be
    ok.
  - Thank you, dear. Thank you.
  - (I already got some for the candle.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (I already got some for the candle.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (I already got some for the candle.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (Uh... A story scroll, I knew Kotaro was lying when he said he didn't like this
    kind of things.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (It looks like there is some kind of powder in this box. I've never seen something
    like this, it looks like there isn't much left.)
  - (There was the <b>Spirituous Powder</b>, but I've taken every last bit of it)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (Do I want to gather this?)
  - (Maybe later.)
  - (I didn't realize this would be moss, and it's highly combustible, I need something
    to gather it and store it safely.)
  - (I really shouldn't be gathering the <b>momiji's leak</b> without anything.)
  - (<b>Souma</b> might have some advices for me.)
  - (I should ask <b>Souma</b> for some advices. Maybe he will know how to <b>collect
    it</b> and <b>store it</b>.)
  - <i>Yukiko uses her scrapper to remove delicately the moss from the momiji. It
    all falls into the pouch she had prepared.</i>
  - (Perfect!)
  - (I have everything <b>Fukuro</b> asked me about. I should get back to him.)
  - (There's only the <b>jade</b> left. But where could that be? Maybe I'll find
    it by investigating on other things.)
  - (This should do the work for Fukuro... hopefully.)
  - (Now, I'll have to hear a <b>deep truth</b> from someone. <b>Souma</b> will probably
    help me!)
  - <i>A scroll seems to outstand from the bookshelf.</i>
  - (A recipe to make a Seal of Truth... I think that might help me!)
  - <i>Yukiko unwraps the scroll and start reading it.</i>
  - (It seems like I need some <b>paper </b>and some <b>black ink</b> to draw on
    it... And cover it with some <b>Spirituous Powder</b>.)
  - (<b>Spirituous Powder</b>? What is that? But also, I have to fill the <b>seal</b>
    by hearing a <b>deep truth</b>.)
  - (What is this? Why are there <b>green stains</b> all over the room? It seems
    too chaotic to be on purpose.)
  - (These green stains on the wall... <b>Jade</b> perhaps?)
  - (This is definitely <b>jade</b>, maybe he was working on the powder.)
  - (I already checked the <b>stains</b>. What surprised me was their <b>presence</b>
    all over the walls.)
  - <i>Yukiko gets closer to the green stains.</i>
  - (Something feels off about that. I am not sure why, but I'll keep that in mind.)
  - (This is quite the mess. Younger, Kotaro wasn't this messy. Was this a bad habit
    he got by becoming a monk?)
  - <i>Kotaro's office is right in front of Yukiko's eyes. It is a quiet space, where
    she finds some items she sometimes uses herself as a artisan.</i>
  - (Though, he has good tastes. This discreet <b>scent of</b> <b>wood</b> is quite
    relaxing.)
  - (Even if I am in a rush, I think this room is filled of informations about his
    work... and... the previous days...)
  - (This night had been one of the worst for a long time.)
  - (The powder... I have to sacrifice a child to save the whole citadel?)
  - (Was that always the case?)
  - <i>As Yukiko gets up, she seems confused. She puts a hand in her hair that were
    feeling much lighter.)</i>
  - WHAT IS THIS?!
  - <i>As Yukiko turns, she sees a pile of her black hair on her pillow. She grabs
    it, slowly understanding that this would never get back on her head.</i>
  - Wait, no no no no no... First, Kotaro, then, the pure soul, and now this? Have
    I done something wrong to deserve all of this?
  - <i>Yukiko sighs deeply, getting calmer.</i>
  - (How is that even possible?)
  - (I can't let Souma see me like. Why did this happen so close to the wedding?!
    I'll have to ask Fukuro, maybe he knows something)
  - (Oh god, how did this happen? I should go see Souma.)
  - Fukuro, I have a problem.
  - Young Yukiko, hello to you too. I see you've gotten a new haircut
  - I woke up like this and I'm hoping you might have something laying around that
    could help me figure out what happened.
  - <i>Fukuro searches around some scrolls</i><i>. </i><i>He hands her </i><i>one
    </i><i>and</i><i> </i><i>Yukiko </i><i>starts </i><i>read</i><i>ing</i><i> through
    it, frowning</i><i>.</i>
  - A yokai who cuts the hair of <b>engaged people</b>? But why?
  - That's for you to figure out, young one.
  - Your riddles are starting to get on my nerves Fukuro.
  - Well, in that case I'm sure I could appease you with the knoweldge that you are
    <b>allowed to wander the park </b>again for your Safety powder.
  - I guess it does help, thank you for the information.
  - Fukuro, where can I find the <b>ingredients of the Safety Powder</b>?
  - Young Yukiko, you may have guess the <b>park was blocked</b> for a reason, didn't
    you?
  - Will I find everything there?
  - You only need to bring me the <b>jade</b> and the <b>momiji's Leak</b>. But be
    cunning, young Yukiko, because it won't be as easy as my riddles.
  - (His riddles were meant to be simple?)
  - <i>As soon as Yukiko appears in her sight, Souma lays his eyes on her, a surprised
    look appearing on his face.</i>
  - Good morning, my love, did you forget to tell me you were planning on getting
    a haircut?
  - Well, it wasn't planned. I woke up with my hair in a pile on my pillow and I
    don't understand how it happened.
  - <i>Yukiko clears her throat, looking bothered.</i>
  - <i>Souma smiles to Yukiko, speaking with a reassuring and soothing voice.</i>
  - You look lovely either way, my love. Long hair or short hair, I love you just
    the same.
  - Do you maybe have a mirror laying around? I haven't gotten the time to look at
    my reflection yet.
  - <i>As Yukiko looks around Souma's stall, the merchant starts acting a bit strange,
    seemingly trying to find his words.</i>
  - Ah, no, no mirrors. My apologies, my love, I've never sold any mirrors.
  - No? All these years and I never realised you didn't. Why not?
  - <i>Souma take some seconds to answer.</i>
  - It was never in demand amongst my clients is all.
  - I see, well thank you, my dear, I'm glad to know the state of my hair does not
    change much.
  - Of course, my love.
  - (I should meet up with Fukuro. He might be able to help me.)
  - Do you need something, my love?
  - I have to gather <b>all the ingredients</b> for the <b>powder</b>.
  - If you don't know where to find them, I won't probably be a great help to you.
  - Perhaps <b>someone in the castle</b> might help you on that, since they were
    the one knowing the <b>recipe of the Safety Powder</b>.
  - Souma, dear, I tried to gather some <b>momiji's leak</b>, do you have any advice
    of <b>what can collect it</b> and <b>how to stock it</b>?
  - Of course, my love. Most people use a type of scrapper. I think you have <b>everything
    at home</b> to <b>create one</b>.
  - And for the container...
  - <i>Souma starts looking for something in his stall. He ends up handing a pouch
    to Yukiko.</i>
  - That should do the trick!
  - Let me pay for this.
  - I'm afraid I will still refuse your money, my love.
  - (He can be mean when he really wants it.)
  - (I am still concerned about the story of the <b>kamikiri</b> and the <b>mirror</b>.)
  - (There must be something related to <b>Souma</b>, but I have to <b>gather</b>
    every <b>hint</b> I need for that.)
  - (Somethings feels weird here. I didn't have any time to inspect yesterday, but
    today, I will take a look around. There has to be <b>hints</b> on Kotaro's death.)
  - (First off, the <b>smell of wood</b>. It's still there since yesterday.)
  - (My investigation is not over. I still have to find some <b>hints</b> about <b>Kotaro's
    death</b> if I want to know what really happened.)
  - (I think I have every hint to understand the scene a bit more... Let's try it!)
  - (Right before leaving the room, he was working on something...)
  - (Is there any clue than can garanty me on <b>what</b> he was working on?)
  - (The <b>jade stains</b>, of course! )
  - (It has to be <b>momiji's scent</b>. Considering the smell stayed until now,
    there should have been a great quantity of <b>momiji's leak</b>.)
  - (I think that confirms me Kotaro was <b>working on the Safety Powder</b>. But
    then, why did it disappear?)
  - (There was wax, so there had to be <b>a candle</b> that was lighted up and burned
    it.)
  - (But why was there a <b>candle</b> in the first place? He should avoid to burn
    the powder while making it!)
  - (These are not <b>Safety Powder remnants</b>. So, he burned something else. Was
    it the recipe, like mentionned in his goodbye letter?)
  - (But something feels wrong, with that letter. When would he have time to write
    it? Especially because <b>this</b> makes me think he was busy.)
  - (His <b>tools weren't tidied</b>. He wouldn't have been using them if he planned
    on dying. Something must have urged him, and the letter doesn't feel right.)
  - (Maybe I could try to recreate the scene?)
  - <i>Yukiko lights up one of the candles on the desk, her eyes widening when she
    spots some </i><b><i>blood stains</i></b><i>.</i>
  - (<b>Blood</b>?! These are too big for a cut, what happened?! Lord Aoyama must
    know something about it.)
  - (Burn marks? Kotaro really used this desk a lot. Wait... <b>spilt dried candle
    wax</b>?)
  - (Something feels off about that. I am not sure why, but I'll keep that in mind.)
  - (I already checked the desk. What surprised me was the <b>wax</b>, spilt all
    over it.)
  - (This is weird, Kotaro was always big on <b>putting everything back in it's place
    </b>but this looks a <b>mess</b>.)
  - (Something feels off about that. I am not sure why, but I'll keep that in mind.)
  - (I already checked Kotaro's tools. What surprised me <b>how messy they were disposed</b>,
    when I know how maniac he is.)
  - (Is this <b>ashes</b>? Why would there be some, are why they on the <b>floor</b>?)
  - (Something feels off about that. I am not sure why, but I'll keep that in mind.)
  - (I already checked the ashes. What surprised me was their <b>presence</b>.)
  - (I have discovered two ingredients of the <b>Safety Powder</b>. I should meet
    Fukuro so he can give me the last one.)
  - (I have discovered two ingredients of the <b>Safety Powder</b>. I should meet
    Fukuro so he can give me the last one.)
  - My lord, I wanted to talk about...
  - <i>Tadanari cuts her off, looking a bit on edge</i><i>.</i>
  - Miss Fukuda, if this isn't about the the <b>powder</b> and you having a <b>solution</b>
    I do not want to hear it!
  - (He looks really angry, and I don't really want to have any issue. I'll leave
    him for the moment.)
  - Sorry for interrupting you, my lord.
  - <i>Yukiko bows under the inquisitive gaze of lord Aoyama.</i>
  - Well in that case, I'd like to ask about monk rights.
  - They can interact with people outside the castle yes? I know my brother could
    before his master's death but after that I didn't see much of him.
  - Of course they can, monks are not prisonners. They are allowed to visit whomever
    they wish.
  - I see, thank you my lord.
  - (I really don't think I wanna talk to lord Aoyama right now.)
  - I don't really want to talk about it Moriyama.
  - Ah, I was only wondering because I heard about your borther's passing and I was
    wondering if you did it out of grief.
  - It's one of the rituals I do myself around my family's death anniversary, I cut
    my hair.
  - You do? And it helps?
  - It does yes. It reminds me I should be cutting my hair, the anniversary is soon.
    I'll need to buy scissors.
  - I could make them for you? I've got <b>everything to craft them at home</b>,
    so there would be no need to spend money.
  - Really? That's really kind of you, thank you.
  - Ah Yukiko, a change of haircut?
  - Thank you Yukiko, I really appreciate this. This reminds me of the yokai I once
    killed with scissors just like this.
  - Moriyama, I have you scissors. Here you go.
  - You killed a yokai with scissors? Why not with your katana?
  - Well I didn't have it on me at the time and the yokai got me unawares as <b>he
    looked exactly like a human</b>.
  - <b>Exactly like a human</b>? That's possible?
  - Of course, many yokais are capable of having a human form. That's why we always
    need to be careful.
  - Well I didn't know that, it's a good thing you told me. Thank you for the information.
  - Of course, I believe everyone should know. Just so we're safe.
  - Do you have your scissors ready, Yukiko?
  - Not yet, Moriyama! I still have to craft it. But I should have <b>every ingredient
    </b>at <b>home</b>.
  - (Souma isn't the one I thought he was... While this is really stressful, I should
    go and discuss about that with him.)
  - (Before talking to Souma about his identity, I should be assured that I will
    not require his help. Maybe gathering the ingredients shall be my priority.)
  - Souma, I need to speak to you, in private.
  - <i>Souma seems confused, but he still accepts.</i>
  - Of course, my love.
  - Souma, I've learned a few things today and I just- Have you been hiding the fact
    that you're a yokai?
  - <i>Souma freezes, staring at Yukiko</i><i> </i><i>with fear and apprehension
    on his face</i><i>.</i>
  - I- I have...
  - <i>Souma</i><i> grows two fluffy tails in his back, while also unveiling two
    fox ears on top of his head. He</i><i> reveals his </i><b><i>kitsune form </i></b><i>as
    he stares down at the floor.</i>
  - You lied to me for years? You bastard!
  - I'm hurt you never told me but I understand the need for secrecy. Despite your
    yokai nature I still love you.
  - <i>Yukiko looks angry and hurt.</i><i> Tears are barely holding onto her eyes.
    Souma, on his side, looks sad and defeated.</i>
  - I- I'm sorry sorry, my love.
  - Don't call me that right now.
  - (I should tell Moriyama, he'll know what to do.)
  - (I can't trust Souma anymore, he's not who I thought he was, but he helped me.
    And I still need his help.)
  - I can hear your thoughts Yukiko... I know what you have in mind. I won't hold
    it against you, I know you are angry. I'll lend you my help as I promised and
    then I'll vanish from your life, you won't have to worry about me.
  - <i>Devasted by the current situation, Souma need to take some time before talking.
    He seems as sad as Yukiko.</i>
  - I realize that our relationship will never be the same after this revelation.
    I cannot express how sorry I am, my love.
  - Yes, I guess you're right.
  - <i>Souma sadly smiles through the pain.</i>
  - I do love you, Yukiko, I'll help you as I promised and then you won't have to
    see me again. Meet me at the <b>park</b>, so I can lend you my power, one last
    time.
  - You look like something is bothering you, do you wish to talk about it?
  - (I am worry about the <b>Safety's Powder ingredients</b>. Shall I tell him?)
  - ...
  - Well it's just about the powder's ingredients. I have to gather <b>jade</b> and
    <b>momiji's leak</b>...
  - But I also have to... sacrifice a child... to get his pure soul...
  - I am sorry to learn the burden that was resting on your shoulders. I wish we
    could find another way, another solution...
  - <i>Souma grabs Yukiko's shoulders.</i>
  - No matter what, I'll do my best to help you, my love.
  - Thank you, my love.
  - I wished we had more time to find another solution to the powder but I'm glad
    you don't look at me differently. I hope you know now that not all yokais are
    bad.
  - I realize that yes. You've never done anything to hurt me. And Fukuro, while
    frustrating at countless times, has been a big help.
  - (Moriyama is still there. Shall I tell him about Souma's nature?)
  - Moriyama, I need your help.
  - (I don't know if I'm ready to let someone kill Souma.)
  - Yes, Yukiko?
  - "My fianc\xE9, Souma, revealed himself to be a yokai! You should take care of
    it."
  - He did? I will start chasing him, thank you for telling me.
  - <i>Moriyama gets back in his house, probably to ready himself to face the yokai.</i>
  - (I'm not really sure how it is related to it... Something might sounds more accurate.)
  - (I'm not really sure how it is related to it... Something might sounds more accurate.)
  - (I'm not really sure how it is related to it... Something might sounds more accurate.)
  - (I'm not really sure how it is related to it... Something might sounds more accurate.)
  - (I'm not really sure how it is related to it... Something might sounds more accurate.)
  - (Kotaro might have been working on the <b>Safety Powder</b>. But is there <b>something
    else</b> that can confirm it?)
  - Oh, and about the <b>jade</b> you need.
  - Yes?
  - And that can start with the <b>jade</b>.
  - How's so?
  - When we were <b>walking</b> in the <b>park</b>, I noticed a strange energy coming
    from the bottom of the lake. I'm pretty sure this is what you need.
  - Meet me there, and I will lend you my powers.
  - <i>Without waiting, Souma leaves Yukiko's home.</i>
  - Kotaro was a great friend. He was always strolling in the surroundings. Last
    time, I've seen him here, in the park, <b>close to the lake</b>.
  - It was like he was checking on something. When he saw me, he joined me like nothing
    happened.
  - But recently, I felt something unusual from the bottom of the lake. A strange
    energy, that shouldn't be there.
  - Let me use my powers to bring it to the surface.
  - <i>Under the keen eye of Yukiko, Souma switches to his kitsune's appearance.
    Both his tails lift up while some balls of energy revolves around him.</i>
  - <i>A green light falls in the center of the lake. After a short period of time,
    multiple shining jades come out of the water.</i>
  - <i>With gracious moves, Souma attracts the jades to him. When he gets in reach
    to, he grabs one and hand it to Yukiko.</i>
  - There you go, my love.
  - (With that, there's only the <b>momiji's leak</b>, which requires me to make
    a <b>scraper</b>.)
  - (I have everything <b>Fukuro</b> asked me about. I should get back to him.)
  - (If I reckon correctly, I must have every ingredient at <b>home</b>.)
  - <i>As Yukiko collects the jade, Souma looks over her shoulder, seeming a bit
    sad.</i>
  - So you did reveal my secret... I guess we have nothing left to say anymore...
  - Goodbye, Yukiko.
  - SOUMA, YOU BASTARD!
  - I'LL KILL YOU SO EVERY YOKAI UNDERSTANDS THEY ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!
  - <i>Souma's shapes switches to become a fox with a white fur. He immediately starts
    running on the water.</i>
  - <i>Moriyama follows him as much as possible while running on the strand.</i>
  - <i>Soon enough, there is nothing left but silence...</i>
  - I think I did what I can, for you. Good luck with the <b>Safety Powder.</b>
  - I need some time alone. You should focus on the <b>powder</b> for now, Yukiko.
  - Fukuro, I gathered the <b>jade</b> and the <b>momiji's leak</b>.
  - Good, young Yukiko. Do you have anything else to do, or shall we begin?
  - I am ready.
  - I need a moment.
  - <i>Yukiko, Fukuro and Tadanari gather together to craft the safety powder in
    kotaro's office.</i>
  - You've finally found a solution to the Safety Powder! Could you have been any
    slower?!
  - Okay, it's done. Now we just need the last ingredient.
  - <i>As soon as Yukiko explains this, Aoyama orders some guards to bring the final
    ingredient.</i>
  - <i>A child in a miserable state is pushed in the room. His eyes seems empty of
    every will.</i>
  - We should calm down, this is a delicate manipulation of materials, one wrong
    move and it could prove catastrophic. Are you ready, young Yukiko?
  - Yes. (It's not like we have much of a choice either way.)
  - Perfect! Just on time, go ahead miss Fukuda, finish the powder now!
  - (Do I want to sacrifice the child to finish the creation of the <b>Safety Powder</b>?)
  - <i>Yukiko has become a monk and saved the city. Her and Souma can enjoy married
    life together.</i>
  - (Maybe I can use the powder to kill Aoyama...)
  - <i>Yukiko becomes a monk, Souma thanks her for keeping his secret but he decides
    to leave the citadel and live his life elsewhere.</i>
  - <i>Yukiko becomes a monk after saving the city and a big hunt for yokais begins.</i>
  - <i>Moriyama becomes lord of the citadel and Yukiko runs away with Souma and they
    live far away from society together.</i>
  - <i>Moriyama becomes lord of the citadel, Souma helps Yukiko run away from the
    citadel but leaves her in another city, safe, and he vanishes from her life.</i>
  - <i>Tadanari is critically injured, Yukiko decides to tell the truth to Moriyama
    about Souma and she is chased out of the city as a result of her keeping his
    identy secret, treason.</i>
  - <i>Tadanari is still the lord of the citadel and Yukiko runs away with Souma
    and they live far away from society together.</i>
  - <i>Tadanari is still the lord of the citadel, Souma decides to help Yukiko escape
    the citadel and leaves her in a different city, safe, before disappearing from
    her life.</i>

    about Souma and she is chased out of the city as a result of her keeping his
